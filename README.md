Here! I have researched numerous statistical distributions, their features, applications, and implementations using Python.

# 1. Normal Distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a fundamental probability that describes the spread of the dataset. It is characterized by its bell-shaped curve, symmetric about the mean, with the majority of data points clustering around the mean and becoming less frequent as they move away from it.

Here! I have researched numerous statistical distributions, their features, applications, and implementations using Python.

# 1. Normal Distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a fundamental probability that describes the spread of the dataset. It is characterized by its bell-shaped curve, symmetric about the mean, with the majority of data points clustering around the mean and becoming less frequent as they move away from it.

# 2. Binomial Distribution
The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has the same probability of success. It is characterized by two parameters: n the number of trials, and p, the probability of success on each trial.

# 3. Uniform Distribution
The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution that describes a situation where all outcomes in an interval are equally likely. In other words, every value within the interval has the same probability of occurring.

# 4. Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.

# 5. Exponential Distribution
The Exponential Distribution is a continuous probability distribution used to model the time between events in a Poisson point process i.e. a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.

# 6. Beta Distribution
The Beta Distribution is a versatile probability distribution useful for modeling events on the interval [0,1]. It is widely used in Bayesian statistics to estimate probabilities and proportions.
